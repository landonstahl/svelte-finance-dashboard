This is a demo app to test Svelte and Vercel deployment.

It should be accessible from [here](https://svelte-finance-dashboard-m2pd34g10-landons-projects-7ad8f1fb.vercel.app/), but I don't actually know how vercel deployments work. This link might be temporary.

The app uses local storage to persist transaction data, so you can add transactions to populate the dashboard.
